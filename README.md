 Medium is an online platform that publishes curated content over a range of topics. There are many contributors(authors) that post their blogs on medium. Users of the platform give “claps” if they like what they see. This is the mechanism implemented by medium to gauge the popularity of a post. This project deals with predicting the popularity of a post using two most popular text classification algorithms.
 
 The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, an online platform to find datasets and enter competitions for the data science community. The data is a collection of 337 full length blog posts on the topics of Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The motivation for popularity prediction for any platform that deals with blog posts or text content is that it can push those posts that it can classify having high popularity to the users of the platform enhancing the experience and driving engagement. The algorithms used to predict the popularity are Naïve-Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machines.
